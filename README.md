### Hi! I'm Marcin Abramowicz

I work in [JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/) on the [Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala).

One day I would love to improve the world using my software development skills.

### Currently I'm working on
- [bazel-bsp](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp) - implementation of the build server protocol for Bazel
- [intellij-bsp](https://github.com/abrams27/intellij-bsp) - new build server protocol plugin for Intellij IDEA

### In the past I have contributed to
- [nussknacker](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker) - a tool that allows to create, manage and run processes on streaming processing frameworks like Apache Flink

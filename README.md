### Hi! I'm Marcin Abramowicz

I work in [JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/) on the [Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala) as an intern.

One day I would love to improve the world using my software development skills.

### Currently I'm working on
- [bazel-bsp](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp) - implementation of the build server protocol for Bazel
- [intellij-bsp](https://github.com/abrams27/intellij-bsp) - new build server protocol plugin for Intellij IDEA
